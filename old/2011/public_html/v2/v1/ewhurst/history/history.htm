        Ewhurst lies on the edge of the Weald which, 125 million years ago, was 
        an area of shallow lakes and marshes. The Wealden clay is rich in fossils 
        and in 1983 a complete skeleton of a dinosaur was discovered. This was 
        found to be a previously unknown species of flesh-eating dinosaur and 
        was named Baryonyx Walkerii, meaning 'heavy claw', in honour of its finder, 
        William Walker. It is now on display at the Natural History Museum.</TD>

        The stone age and bronze age peoples avoided the dense impenetrable forest 
        of the Weald in favour of the higher ground to the north and this area 
        was on of the last parts of Britain to become permanently settled. At 
        the end of the Iron Age a hill fort was constructed on Holmbury Hill.</TD>

        The roman road of Stane Street passes through this part of Surrey and 
        a branch road runs almost the full length of the parish from Rowhook in 
        the south to Horseblock Hollow in the north. The Romans established a 
        villa at Rapsley, which was excavated in the 1960s. The site is thought 
        to have been occupied from AD80 - AD330 and interesting discoveries include 
        fragments of a glass goblet and an unusual vase decorated with a 'Mural 
        Crown'. A tile-kiln had already been discovered and excavated in 1836 
        to the south west of the villa site.</TD>

      <TD><STRONG>The Saxons</STRONG><BR>
        After the Romans left, the Weald was still largely uninhabited and wild. 
        The Saxons settled in the sheltered valleys to the north but looked to 
        the Weald as a source of timber and for hunting and grazing animals. At 
        first they would have only journeyed into the forest in the summer months, 
        but gradually small settlements developed and eventually these would have 
        come to be inhabited all the year round. The people who lived in these 
        isolated farmsteads would have still looked to their parent villages to 
        the north for their communal needs and it was much later before a village 
        was established at Ewhurst.</TD>

        The feudal system of manors had developed under the Saxons and, at the 
        time of the conquest, Ewhurst was part of the Royal Manor of Gumshall. 
        By the medieval period Ewhurst was developing into a separate community 
        with its own church and became a parish in its own right in 1291.</TD>

        The richness of the Weald's natural resources led it to become the industrial 
        centre of Britain, as both the iron and glass industries needed large 
        amounts of timber for fuel. There is a site of a bloomery iron works at 
        Coneyhurst Gill and two glass making sites at Ellen's Green and Summersbury. 
        The wealth of the area can also be seen in the many fine timber framed 
        houses dating from this period.</TD>

        By the 17th century coal replaced timber as fuel and the industries moved 
        north and the area declined. The heavy clay and poor roads contributed 
        to its isolation. Farming and woodcrafts formed the basis of the local 
        economy but there was much poverty and poaching and smuggling was rife.</TD>

        The village remained small and isolated until the late 19th century, when 
        improved communications and a growing appreciation of the beauty of the 
        wild Surrey countryside encouraged many wealthy businessmen and artistic 
        people to move into the area. They commissioned architects to design new 
        houses for them, or restored and enlarged the old timber frame houses.</TD>
