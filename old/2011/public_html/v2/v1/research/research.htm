      <TD>Ewhurst resident Andy Bailey has embarked on a project to research the 
        lives and stories of all those whose names are recorded on the Ewhurst 
        war memorial. During the first phase he is concentrating on the fallen 
        of the First World War and is appealing for information. Andy writes....&quot; 
        I am currently researching Ewhurst during the First World War, the men 
        who served, and the men who did not return. My concern is that with the 
        passage of time, these men may only be remembered by relatives and the 
        future village may only identify this period with a list of names on the 
        war memorial. I would like to make more information available to whoever 
        may show interest in the future, so that the memory of these local men 
        may endure. 
        <p>In all likelihood this will take the form of an internet site and some 
          form of printed material to be held within the village for future reference.&quot;</p>

      <TD> <b>Manorial Records<BR>
        </b> The parish of Ewhurst is covered by seven manors - Gumshall Towerhill, 
        Gumshall Netley, Somersbury, Coneyhurst, Pollingfold, Vachery, and Westland.<BR>
        Manors developed as a feudal system of land holding during the Saxon period. 
        The principal manor in this area was the Manor of Gumesele which originally 
        included the present day Gomshall, Shere, Ewhurst and Cranleigh, but by 
        the time of the Norman Conquest had been split into two - Shere (including 
        Cranleigh) and Gumesele (including Ewhurst). Shere was held by Edith, 
        the widow of Edward the Confessor, but Gumsesle was a Royal Manor held 
        by King Harold himself. In 1154, Henry II divided the Manor of Gumesele 
        into three - West Gomshall, East Gomshall and Somersbury. Somersbury was 
        wholly within what is now Ewhurst parish and both of the Manors of Gomshall 
        held parcels of land in Ewhurst. In 1240 West Gomshall was granted to 
        the Abbey of Netley in Hampshire and became known as Gomshall Netley. 
        East Gomshall was granted to The Abbey of St Mary Graces, Tower Hill, 
        London in 1376 and became known as Gomshall Towerhill. After the dissolution 
        both Manors were acquired by the Bray family, who already held Shere Eboracum 
        (Shere) and Shere Vachery (Cranleigh). The Bray family still hold the 
        title of Lord of the Manor.<BR>
        Smaller manors were created by a process known as subinfeudation. Pollingfold 
        was a sub-manor held from Gomshall Towerhill. and Coneyhurst was a sub-manor 
        held from Somersbury. Breach and Maybanks are both described as manors 
        in the Victoria County History, but no records survive for them. Breach 
        was held from Gomshall Netley and Maybanks from Pollingfold. <BR>
        In addition parts of the western side of the parish were included in the 
        manor of Shere Vachery and the Manor of Westland which was part of the 
        Evelyn Estates held land in Ellen's Green.</TD>

      <TD> Ewhurst History Society has extracts from manorial records relating 
        to houses and land in Ewhurst, but because of the complexity of the holdings 
        there is also some overlap with neighbouring parishes of Cranleigh, Shere, 
        Abinger and Rudgwick.</TD>
