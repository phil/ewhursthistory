        <p>Ewhurst is a village about 35 miles south west of London on the Surrey 
          Sussex border. Close by is the larger village of Cranleigh and the nearest 
          towns of Guildford, Dorking and Horsham, are each about 10 miles away.</p>
        <p>The village takes its name from the Old English 'hyrst', meaning 'wooded-hill' 
          and 'iw' meaning 'yew tree' (the English Place Name Society suggests 
          'Yew Wood'). In the Natural History and Antiquities of the County of 
          Surrey published in 1719 Aubrey notes &quot;the vast quantities of yew 
          trees that formerly abounded here&quot;. The first recorded spelling 
          is &quot;Iuherst&quot; in 1179. A popular interpretation is that the 
          name derived from ewe-sheep as the wool trade was important in medieval 
          times, but this seems unlikely as the name is much older and dates from 
          the Saxon period. The village sign on the green, opposite the Bulls 
          Head, shows both a ewe-sheep and a yew tree and also incorporates the 
          Royal Insignia and the date 1953, as it was erected to commemorate the 
          Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II.</p>
        <p>The parish of Ewhurst, like many in the southern part of Surrey, is 
          long and thin, stretching some six miles from Pitch Hill in the north 
          to the hamlet of Ellen's Green on the Sussex border in the south, but 
          is less than two miles from east to west. It covers an area of approximately 
          5,400 acres with a population at present of about 2,500. Above the village 
          Pitch Hill stands out from the Greensand escarpment with commanding 
          views over the Weald to the South Downs. Extending northwards is the 
          Hurtwood, a large area of woodland and common land forming part of the 
          Surrey Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty. Much of the parish, 
          however, is on the Weald Clay, which in ancient times was a vast forest 
          and is, today, despite the Great Storm of 1987, still one of the most 
          densely wooded areas of Britain.</p>
